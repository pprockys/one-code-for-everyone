1.I am making this repository because most of the beginner face  lack of information about coding contest/hackathon etc. in their begining days.
2.I know these information are scattered on Google/Facebook/Instagram But its very diffcult for any beginner to receive these  informations just before contest.
3.I hope information of this repository will be useful for  beginner's as well as for Pro's sometimes.
4.I am beginner in almost every field (Coding,Github,Development) and i studied mardown recentely so sorry for any mistakes.
