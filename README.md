#### I am making this repository because i faced too much lack of information about coding contest/hackathon etc.(Like i came to know about  SIH,DSC,HACKWITHINFY) etc. type of contest just before few month's/day's.
#### I know these information are scattered on Google/Facebook/Instagram But its very diffcult for any beginner to receive these  informations just before contest.
#### I hope information of this repository will be useful for  beginner's as well as for Pro's sometimes.
#### I am beginner in almost every field (Coding,Github,Development) and i studied mardown recentely so sorry for any mistakes.
