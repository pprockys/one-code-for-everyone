1.I am making this repository because most of the beginner face  lack of information about coding contest/hackathon etc. in their begining days.<br>
2.I know these information are scattered on Google/Facebook/Instagram But its very diffcult for any beginner to receive these  informations just before contest.<br>
3.I hope information of this repository will be useful for  beginner's as well as for Pro's sometimes.<br>
4.I am beginner in almost every field (Coding,Github,Development) and i studied mardown recentely so sorry for any mistakes.<br>
